Welcome to Hacker Brewery üß™
Hacker Brewery is a nimble software studio founded in 2024. Our mission is to build experiences that we love‚Äîand that others will love too. From tools to games to exploratory tech, we focus on crafting high-quality, playful, and useful software that reflects our curiosity and creativity.

Our Build Philosophy ‚öôÔ∏è
At the core of our studio are a few simple but powerful principles:

Build What We‚Äôd Use: We trust our own instincts. If we find it fun, useful, or delightful, others probably will too.

Tight Team, Shared Vision: A small, close-knit team enables fast iteration and aligned thinking.

Creative Feedback Loops: We approach projects like experiments‚Äîtest fast, learn fast, keep it fun.

Studio Summary üß±
Hacker Brewery is more than just a studio‚Äîit‚Äôs a mindset. We blend curiosity, technical skill, and creative storytelling to build projects that blur the line between software and experience. Whether it‚Äôs a tool, game, or weird prototype, we‚Äôre here to ship ideas that speak for themselves.
